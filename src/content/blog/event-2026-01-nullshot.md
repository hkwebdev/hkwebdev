*Vibe coding jam with Nullshot*

Think vibe coding meets venture funding meets code jams! We kick off the year with a talk from Cooper from Nullshot.

## About Nullshot

BUILD THE FUTURE, TOGETHER. Chat, build and own collectively. All on one platform. From ideas to omnichain tokens—everything starts here. No gatekeepers, no silent insiders. Just collective ingenuity—funded and owned by the people who show up.

Join serial entrepreneur Joseph Cooper for a live look at Nullshot.ai, a decentralized platform where AI agents and Web3 tokenomics transform collaborative chats into functional apps. Watch him "live jam" in real-time with inputs from the audience to demonstrate how communities can co-create, tokenize, and launch products through the power of the Model Context Protocol.

Alpha is out now on: [Nullshot.ai](https://nullshot.ai)
