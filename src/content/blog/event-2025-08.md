*Vibe Coding Panel*

We have two speakers and a panel this month. Hear Denis from Preferrd and Nad from Lovable (remote) speak about their take on Vibe Coding in the form of two short talks and a panel. We cover the what why and how of vibe coding followed by a discussion and open panel.

Nad Christie from Loveable speakes of being a founding desinger and how to use Loveable to vibecode.

Denis Tsoi is the CTO of Preferrd, bringing over a decade of experience in software engineering and technical leadership. A self-taught developer who transitioned from finance to tech, Denis has built his expertise across frontend and full-stack development at companies including Mox Bank (Standard Chartered's digital banking initiative) and Covergo.

Based in Hong Kong, he's an active contributor to the developer community with 10,000+ reputation on Stack Overflow and maintains a strong presence on GitHub. Denis specializes in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and modern web architectures, with a focus on building scalable, user-centric solutions.

Talk Description: "It Depends: Beyond Vibe Coding - Engineering Context for AI Development"

In this talk, we'll explore why successful AI development requires more than intuition and trending solutions. While "vibe coding" might work for simple applications, AI systems demand a deeper understanding of engineering context.

We'll examine:
1. Why context matters: How business requirements, data constraints, and user needs shape AI solutions
1. Moving beyond copy-paste AI: Building systems that actually solve problems rather than just implementing the latest models
1. The hidden complexities: Infrastructure, scalability, and maintenance considerations often overlooked in AI projects
1. Real-world case studies: Examples where understanding context made the difference between AI success and expensive failure
1. This talk is for developers, technical leaders, and anyone involved in AI implementation who wants to move beyond superficial solutions to create AI systems that deliver real value.
