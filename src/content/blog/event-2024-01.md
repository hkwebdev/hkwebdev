*CMS Options 2023 - FireCMS: Google’s headless CMS*

By Rhys Turner

This is the first of a series that reviews current CMS options.

FireCMS is a react front end for a Firebase backend. It’s a great option for those looking for a headless CMS. It’s very flexible and can even be decoupled from Firebase and use any database instead.

This talk is a brief overview of the Google solutions and a look into its potential. We get hands on and see how it’s perfect for little projects that need a way to update and manage content.
