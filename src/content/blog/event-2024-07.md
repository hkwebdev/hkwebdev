*The Art of Simple (but thriving) Side Projects*

By Patrick Rabier

The tech space of 2024 is one of endless integrations and coupling between frameworks, cloud providers, managed databases, SaaS products.

This event will focus on smaller side projects and experiments, using a reference web app to demonstrate how freeing ourselves from a lot of this complexity can lead to simpler and healthier projects that thrive nonetheless (and at low cost).

We will discuss the practices behind a good side project and cover tips and tricks regarding code base, tech stack and deployment model (including how you could even host something from home)

Patrick has been an engineer and creative technologist in Hong Kong for the better part of a decade. He loves writing code and defying the standards of our industry through practical experiments. He loves open source and often publishes on his github [patrixr](https://github.com/patrixr).

His recent work includes non-profit initiatives with the Crossroads Foundation, generative art pieces (showcased last year at the Electronic Museum event) and technical leadership at Accenture.

Some key topics we will discuss include server-side rendering, Golang, hosting at home, caching, content management.
