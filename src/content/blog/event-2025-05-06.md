# Running DeepSeek R1 on a Raspberry Pi: AI on the Edge with an External GPU
## Details

In the last meetup we ran DeepSeek R1 on a Raspberry Pi and it worked! But it was slow. This time we will beef up the specs and run DeepSeek with an external GPU on a Raspberry Pi.

Join us for an in-depth session on deploying super charging DeepSeek R1, an AI-powered reasoning and code generation model, on a Raspberry Pi. We’ll explore hardware requirements, software setup, performance optimization, and real-world applications for web developers and IoT enthusiasts. Learn the next steps after how to install, configure, and run DeepSeek R1 locally but now with an extenral GPU, enabling AI-powered coding assistance and offline inference. We’ll also discuss challenges, optimizations, and future possibilities for low-power AI computing. A live demo will showcase DeepSeek R1 running on a Raspberry Pi with a GPU, demonstrating its capabilities in a real-world setting. Q&A session included!
